As a player, I want similar numbered blocks to merge when they touch so that I can aim to reach the
2048 block.
    Acceptance criteria:
    - When two blocks with the same number touch, they should merge into one block with the sum of the
two numbers.
    - The merging of blocks should only occur once per move for each individual block.
