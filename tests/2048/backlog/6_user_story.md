As a player, I want the game to end if there are no valid moves left so that I know when the game is
over.
    Acceptance criteria:
    - If the board is full and no adjacent blocks can be merged, the game should display a "Game Over"
message.
    - The "Game Over" message should include the player's final score and an option to start a new game.
