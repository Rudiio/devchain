As a player, I want to control the movement of the blocks using keyboard arrow keys or swipe gestures
so that I can play the game easily.
    Acceptance criteria:
    - Pressing the arrow keys or swiping on a touchscreen should move the blocks in the corresponding
direction.
    - The blocks should move as far as possible in the chosen direction until they hit the edge of the
board or another block.
