            "instructions": "In the `InputHandler` class within `input_handler.py`, locate the `translate_input_to_action` method. Inspect the `key_action_mapping` dictionary to ensure that each key is mapped to the correct movement direction. If any mappings are found to be inverted, correct them to match the expected behavior. For example, if pressing the 'up' arrow key results in the game character moving down, invert this mapping so that the 'up' arrow key correctly corresponds to an upward movement."

            "instructions": "In the `InputHandler` class within `input_handler.py`, locate the `handle_events` method. Remove the call to `perform_move` within this method. Modify the method to return the action determined by the user's input. Then, in `main.py`, adjust the `main_game_loop` function to receive the action returned from `handle_events` and call `perform_move` accordingly. This change ensures that `perform_move` is only called once per valid input, preventing double execution."

Instead, implement a non-blocking approach that allows the message to be displayed for 2 seconds while still processing input events.
