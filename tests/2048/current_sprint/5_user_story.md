As a player, I want to win the game when I create a 2048 block so that I have a clear goal to achieve.
    Acceptance criteria:
    - When a 2048 block is formed on the board, the game should display a "You Win" message.
    - The game should offer an option to continue playing or to start a new game after winning.
