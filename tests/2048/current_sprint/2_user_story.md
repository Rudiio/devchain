As a player, I want to move all blocks in one direction with a single input so that I can play the game as intended.
    Acceptance criteria:
    - When I swipe or press an arrow key in a direction (up, down, left, or right), all blocks should move in that direction.
    - Blocks should continue to move in the specified direction until they are blocked by another block or the edge of the game board.
