As a player, I want same-number blocks to merge upon touch so that I can progress in the game.
    Acceptance criteria:
    - When two blocks with the same number touch as a result of a move, they should merge into one block with the sum of the two numbers.
    - The merging of blocks should only happen once per move, even if the resulting block's number matches adjacent blocks.
