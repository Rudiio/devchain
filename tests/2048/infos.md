The rules of the game 2048 are as follows: Control all blocks to move in one direction at a time. If there
are two numbers that are the same, they will merge (ie, get the sum). After each operation, a 2 or 4 will be randomly
generated in an empty square. If the player creates a 2048 block, they win the game. If all 100 squares (10x10) are filled
and cannot be merged, the game ends. Players can choose four directions: up, down, left, or right. If the numbers on the
board shift or merge, it is considered a valid move. If there are the same numbers on the direction chosen, they will merge.
Each valid move can merge at the same time, but continuous merging is not allowed. The sum of all newly generated numbers
from merging is the effective score for that move. If there are empty spaces in the direction chosen or in the row or column
ahead, a random number (which can still be 2 or 4) will appear. If the board is filled with numbers and no valid moves can
be made, the player loses and the game ends. If a 2048 block appears on the board, the player wins and the game ends.

## Description
MergeMaster 2048 is a single-player puzzle game that challenges players to slide numbered blocks on a grid to combine them and reach the ultimate goal of creating a 2048 block. The game is to be developed using Python and Pygame, ensuring a smooth and responsive experience on both desktop and mobile platforms. The gameplay mechanics are straightforward: with a swipe or arrow key press, players move all blocks in the chosen direction until they are obstructed by another block or the edge of the board. When two blocks with the same number collide due to a move, they merge into a single block with their combined value, but each pair of blocks can only merge once per move. After every valid move, which is defined as any action that moves or merges at least one block, a new block with a value of 2 or 4 spawns in a random empty space, keeping the game challenging. Players aim to create a block with the value of 2048, upon which they are greeted with a "You Win" message and the choice to either continue playing or restart the game. The game concludes with a "Game Over" message if the board fills up and no further moves or merges are possible, prompting players to start anew. Throughout the game, players can keep track of their progress through a real-time updated score that reflects the sum of all numbers from merged blocks. The user interface must be simple and intuitive, facilitating easy navigation and an engaging gameplay experience across different devices.
