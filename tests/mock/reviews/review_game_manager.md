### Review
#### Issues
1. The tests do not cover the initialization of the game board with two random numbers.
2. The tests do not verify the handling of edge cases, such as pressing keys that do not result in a valid move.
3. The tests do not cover the functionality of adding a new random number to the grid after each valid move.
4. The tests do not cover the user interface aspects, such as the display of the grid, score, and end-game messages beyond the initial rendering.
5. The GameManager class does not have a method to handle player moves or to merge blocks, which are core functionalities of the game.

#### Fixes
1. Add a test to ensure that two random numbers are placed on the grid when the game is reset:
    ```python
    def test_reset_game_initial_numbers(self):
        self.game_manager.reset_game(self.game_board_mock)
        non_zero_count = sum(row.count(0) for row in self.game_board_mock.grid)
        self.assertEqual(non_zero_count, 98)  # 100 - 2 initial numbers
    ```
2. Add tests to verify that invalid moves do not change the game state:
    ```python
    def test_invalid_move(self):
        # Assuming that `make_move` is a method to handle moves
        self.game_board_mock.can_move.return_value = False
        self.game_manager.make_move('up')
        self.game_board_mock.move_up.assert_not_called()
        self.renderer_mock.render_grid.assert_not_called()
    ```
3. Add a test to verify that a new number is added after a valid move:
    ```python
    def test_new_number_after_valid_move(self):
        # Assuming that `make_move` and `add_random_number` are methods to handle moves and add numbers
        self.game_board_mock.can_move.return_value = True
        self.game_manager.make_move('up')
        self.game_board_mock.add_random_number.assert_called_once()
    ```
4. Implement tests for the user interface updates after moves, merges, and game over conditions:
    ```python
    def test_ui_updates_after_move(self):
        # Assuming that `make_move` is a method to handle moves
        self.game_board_mock.can_move.return_value = True
        self.game_manager.make_move('up')
        self.renderer_mock.render_grid.assert_called_with(self.game_board_mock.grid)
    ```
5. Implement the missing methods for handling player moves and merging blocks in the GameManager class:
    ```python
    def make_move(self, direction):
        # Pseudocode for handling moves
        if direction == 'up' and self.game_board.can_move_up():
            self.game_board.move_up()
            self.update_score(self.game_board.merge_blocks())
            self.game_board.add_random_number()
            self.renderer.render_grid(self.game_board.grid)
    ```
