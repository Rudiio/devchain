## Name
Snake Odyssey

## Description
Snake Odyssey is a Python-based game developed using the Pygame library, designed to provide an engaging and interactive experience for players. The game features a clear and intuitive start screen with a "Start Game" button and instructions on how to play. Players control a snake's movement using the arrow keys, with the objective of eating food to grow longer and increase their score, which is prominently displayed on the screen. The game ends if the snake collides with the walls or itself, triggering a "Game Over" message. Sound effects enhance the gameplay experience, playing when the snake eats food or when the game ends. After a game over, players have the option to restart the game, resetting it to its initial state. The application is designed to run smoothly on standard desktop environments with Python and Pygame installed, ensuring responsive controls and a visually appealing graphical interface.
