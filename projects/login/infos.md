# Project Informations

## Request
Design and develop a login and registration page using Bootstrap included via CDN. Implement interactivity between the pages. Store the data in the local storage without using a backend. The whole logic should be done using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript but use python and flask ONLY to render the front-end. Ensure that the page is aesthetically pleasing and responsive. Do not use frameworks like Vue or React. Consider including features such as login success and registration message notifications. Aim to provide users with a simple, enjoyable, and visually attractive experience.

SecureVault

## Description
SecureVault is an application designed to provide a secure and user-friendly environment for users to register and access their accounts. The application will feature a registration form requiring a username, email, and password, with a confirmation step for the password to prevent typos. Upon successful registration or login, users will be greeted with a confirmation message and redirected to a welcome page, respectively. Visual feedback in the form of success notifications and error messages will be provided for user actions. The interface will be modern and visually appealing, with a consistent color scheme and typography. The front-end will be developed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, while the back-end will be handled by Python and Flask solely for rendering purposes. Bootstrap will be used for styling and ensuring responsiveness. User credentials will be stored in local storage, as no back-end database will be involved. All interactivity, particularly between the login and registration pages, will be managed through JavaScript, without the use of frameworks like Vue or React, adhering to the application's simplicity and security-focused design.
