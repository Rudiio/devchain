As a player, I want to reset the simulation while keeping the current grid state to watch the cells evolve from the same starting point again.
    Acceptance criteria:
    - There should be a "Reset" button that stops the simulation and resets it to the initial state without clearing the grid.
    - The simulation should be ready to start again from the same grid state when the "Reset" button is pressed.
