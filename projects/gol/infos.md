## Request
Conway's game of life in python using pygame

## Name
LifeCraft: The Cellular Automaton Explorer

## Description
**Application Overview: LifeCraft: The Cellular Automaton Explorer**

LifeCraft is an interactive application designed to simulate Conway's Game of Life, a cellular automaton where cells on a grid evolve through discrete time steps according to a set of rules. The application will provide a graphical user interface (GUI) that allows players to create, visualize, and explore the behavior of cellular automata in a two-dimensional space.

**Key Features:**

1. **New Game Initialization:**
   - The application will feature a "New Game" button that, when pressed, resets the grid to an empty state, effectively starting a new simulation.
   - The grid will be cleared of any living cells, ensuring that the player starts with a blank canvas for each new game.

2. **Interactive Cell Population:**
   - Players will be able to click on individual cells within the grid to toggle their state. A dead cell will become alive, and a living cell will become dead upon clicking.
   - The state change of each cell will be immediately visible to the player, with distinct visual representations for alive and dead states.

**Technical Requirements:**

1. **Programming Language and Library:**
   - The application will be developed in Python, utilizing the pygame library to handle graphics, user input, and the game loop.

2. **Graphical User Interface:**
   - A GUI will be implemented to display the grid of cells. This interface will be the main interaction point for the player.
   - The GUI will be designed to be user-friendly and intuitive, allowing for easy navigation and interaction with the game's features.

3. **Cell Visualization:**
   - Each cell on the grid will have a unique visual representation. Alive cells will be distinguished from dead cells using different colors or shapes.
   - The visual distinction will aid players in understanding the current state of the grid and the evolution of the cells.

4. **Game of Life Rules:**
   - The application will accurately implement the rules of Conway's Game of Life, which dictate the evolution of the cells from one generation to the next.
   - These rules will be the core logic of the simulation and must be followed to ensure the correct behavior of the cellular automaton.

The goal of LifeCraft is to provide an engaging platform for players to experiment with and observe the fascinating patterns that emerge from the simple rules of Conway's Game of Life. The application should be both educational and entertaining, catering to enthusiasts of cellular automata and those curious about emergent systems.
