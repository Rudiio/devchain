### Review
#### Issues
1. The implementation of `renderer.py` seems to correspond to the requirements of the 2048 Game software. It provides functionality to render the game grid, score, and end-game messages using Pygame, which is appropriate for a game like 2048.
2. The implementation of `renderer.py` respects the design as outlined in the class diagram. The class contains methods for rendering the grid, score, and end-game messages, as well as initializing the screen, which are all represented in the class diagram.
3. The code logic inside of `renderer.py` appears to be correct. It initializes the Pygame screen, renders the grid with appropriate colors for each cell value, displays the score, and shows an end-game message when necessary. The update_display method is used to refresh the screen, which is standard practice in Pygame applications.
4. All the essential functions of `renderer.py` seem to be fully implemented. The class provides methods for all the rendering tasks that would be expected in a 2048 game.
