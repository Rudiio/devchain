# Project Informations

## Request
Design a tic-tac-toe game with a user-friendly interface, allowing two players to take turns and determining the winner. Use python with the pygame library.

## Name
Tic-Tac-Toe Triumph

## Description
**Tic-Tac-Toe Triumph Application Overview**

Tic-Tac-Toe Triumph is a digital adaptation of the classic two-player strategy game, designed to provide an engaging and competitive experience for users who wish to challenge each other in a match of wits and strategy. The application will be developed in Python, utilizing the pygame library to create a graphical user interface (GUI) that is both visually appealing and user-friendly.

**Core Features and Requirements:**

1. **New Game Initiation:**
   - The application will feature a main screen with an option to start a new game.
   - Upon selecting to start a new game, the application will prompt the users to enter their names, establishing a personalized experience.

2. **Gameplay Mechanics:**
   - The game will be played on a standard 3x3 grid, which will be graphically represented on the screen.
   - Players will take turns to place their respective marks (X or O) on the grid by clicking on an empty cell.
   - The application will enforce turn-based play, ensuring that each player can only place a mark during their turn.

3. **Winning and Draw Conditions:**
   - The application will automatically detect and declare a winner when a player successfully aligns three of their marks horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.
   - In the event that all cells are occupied without a winner, the game will announce a draw.

4. **User Interface:**
   - The GUI will be clean, modern, and intuitive, with visual cues to indicate whose turn it is and how to place a mark.
   - The interface will be designed to facilitate easy navigation and provide a seamless gaming experience.

5. **Invalid Move Handling:**
   - The game will prevent players from making invalid moves, such as placing a mark in an already occupied cell.
   - When an invalid move is attempted, the game will prompt the player to select a different, unoccupied cell.

6. **Two-Player Support:**
   - The game will support two human players in a local multiplayer setting, without the inclusion of AI opponents.

**Development Considerations:**

- The use of the pygame library is mandatory, and the game's development will be structured around its capabilities and limitations.
- The application should be optimized for performance to ensure smooth gameplay and responsive user interactions.
- The code should be modular and well-documented to facilitate future maintenance and potential feature expansions.

This application aims to deliver a nostalgic yet refreshed gaming experience, capturing the essence of tic-tac-toe while leveraging modern technology to enhance playability and enjoyment. The developer should keep in mind the balance between simplicity, which is at the heart of tic-tac-toe, and the need for a polished and engaging user interface.
