As a player, I want the game to determine the winner or a draw when the game ends.
    Acceptance criteria:
    - The game should automatically detect and announce a winner when a player has three of their marks in a row, column, or diagonal.
    - The game should announce a draw if all cells are filled and there is no winner.
