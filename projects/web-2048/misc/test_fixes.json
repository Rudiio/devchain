            "instructions": "Locate the `/static/style.css` file in the project repository. Create a new CSS class for each tile number that requires a unique background color. For example, if the tile number is 2, you might create a class `.tile-2` with a background color of your choice. Repeat this process for each tile number that needs a unique color, ensuring that the colors are distinct and visually pleasing. Use hexadecimal color codes for consistency and precision. Once you have added all the necessary classes, save the file and push the changes to the repository. Ensure that you test the changes locally by running the application and verifying that each tile displays the correct background color corresponding to its number."
