# Project Informations

## Request
Web-based 2048 game. The game should enable players to slide numbered tiles on a grid to combine them into a tile numbered 2048, with the implementation including smooth animations and responsive controls for an engaging user experience. Use flask and python only to render the front-end of the application. The whole application should be handled directly in the front-end via javascript.

## Name
TileMaster 2048

## Description
TileMaster 2048 is an engaging and modern web-based single-player puzzle game that challenges players to slide numbered tiles on a grid using keyboard arrow keys to combine them and ultimately create a tile numbered 2048, signaling a win. The game is initiated by a "New Game" button, which resets the game state for a fresh start. As players interact with the game, they will experience smooth, animated movements of the tiles, enhancing the visual appeal and providing a dynamic gaming experience. The player's score is displayed and updated in real-time, reflecting the player's progress throughout the game. The game concludes with a "Game Over" message when no further moves are possible, indicating the end of the play session. TileMaster 2048 is to be implemented using Flask for the backend, which will serve the application, and JavaScript for the frontend, which will handle all game logic, animations, and user interactions independently. The user interface will be clean and modern, utilizing a grid layout for the tiles, and the game will operate without the need for any plugins or external libraries beyond the standard web technologies of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, ensuring accessibility and ease of use across a wide range of web browsers.
