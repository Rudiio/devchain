TaskWave

## Description
TaskWave is a web-based TODO application designed to enhance personal productivity by allowing users to manage their tasks efficiently. The application will enable users to create, view, edit, and list tasks with an associated status of 'open' or 'closed'. Users can add new tasks through a user-friendly interface, change the status of tasks to 'closed' with visual feedback, and delete tasks as needed. The application will automatically save all task information to a JSON file for persistent storage, ensuring that any additions, status changes, or deletions are reflected in real-time or upon application closure. Upon startup, TaskWave will load existing tasks from the JSON file, displaying them with their current statuses. The user interface will be styled with TailwindCSS to provide a responsive and visually appealing experience. The backend will be powered by Flask, utilizing Python for server-side operations, including file handling for the JSON storage. This combination of features aims to deliver a seamless and intuitive task management experience for users while maintaining a clean and modern design.
