            "instructions": "First, verify that the `favicon.ico` file is present in the `static` directory of the Flask application. If it is missing, add the file to the directory. Next, check the route handler in `app.py` that serves the favicon and ensure the path to `favicon.ico` is correctly specified. Implement error handling within the route to catch a `NotFound` exception and respond appropriately, either by serving a default favicon or returning a 404 error response."
