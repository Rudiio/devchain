As a player, I want to control a paddle using keyboard inputs to hit the ball back to the AI opponent.
    Acceptance criteria:
    - When I press the up arrow key, the paddle should move upwards.
    - When I press the down arrow key, the paddle should move downwards.
    - The paddle's movement should be smooth and responsive to the key inputs.
