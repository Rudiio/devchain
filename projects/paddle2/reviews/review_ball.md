### Review
#### Issues
1. The test `test_collide_with_paddle` does not account for the vertical position of the ball and paddle, which could lead to false positives if the ball is not aligned vertically with the paddle.
2. The test `test_collide_with_boundaries` only tests the collision with the top and bottom boundaries at the exact points where the ball's edge touches the boundary. It does not test the scenario where the ball has already moved beyond the boundary, which could occur between frames.
3. The `collide_with_paddle` method in the `Ball` class only reverses the horizontal speed of the ball. It does not account for the possibility of the ball hitting the top or bottom edge of the paddle, which should also reverse the vertical speed.
4. The `reset` method in the `Ball` class reverses the horizontal speed of the ball. This could lead to inconsistent gameplay if the ball is reset after scoring a point, as the direction of the ball would always be towards the player who just scored.
5. The `increase_speed` method increases the speed of the ball by a fixed percentage. This could lead to an exponential increase in speed, making the game unplayable after a few hits.

#### Fixes
1. Modify the `test_collide_with_paddle` to ensure that the ball is within the vertical range of the paddle:
    ```python
    def test_collide_with_paddle(self):
        paddle = Paddle(x=40, y=40, speed=0, height=20, width=10, boundary_top=0, boundary_bottom=100)
        self.ball.x = 45  # Position the ball to collide with the paddle
        self.ball.y = 50  # Ensure the ball is vertically aligned with the paddle
        self.ball.collide_with_paddle(paddle)
        self.assertEqual(self.ball.speed_x, -5)  # Speed should be reversed
    ```
2. Modify the `test_collide_with_boundaries` to test for collisions beyond the boundary:
    ```python
    def test_collide_with_boundaries(self):
        boundary_top = 0
        boundary_bottom = 100
        self.ball.y = boundary_top - 1  # Position the ball beyond the top boundary
        self.ball.collide_with_boundaries(boundary_top, boundary_bottom)
        self.assertEqual(self.ball.speed_y, 5)  # Speed should be reversed

        self.ball.y = boundary_bottom + 1  # Position the ball beyond the bottom boundary
        self.ball.collide_with_boundaries(boundary_top, boundary_bottom)
        self.assertEqual(self.ball.speed_y, -5)  # Speed should be reversed
    ```
3. Update the `collide_with_paddle` method to account for vertical collisions:
    ```python
    def collide_with_paddle(self, paddle):
        if self.get_rect().colliderect(paddle.get_rect()):
            if self.x < paddle.x or self.x > paddle.x + paddle.width:
                self.speed_x = -self.speed_x  # Reflect the horizontal direction
            if self.y < paddle.y or self.y > paddle.y + paddle.height:
                self.speed_y = -self.speed_y  # Reflect the vertical direction
    ```
4. Modify the `reset` method to not reverse the horizontal speed:
    ```python
    def reset(self, reset_x, reset_y, speed_x):
        self.x = reset_x
        self.y = reset_y
        self.speed_x = speed_x  # Set the horizontal direction based on the last point scored
    ```
5. Modify the `increase_speed` method to cap the speed increase:
    ```python
    def increase_speed(self, max_speed_x, max_speed_y):
        self.speed_x = min(self.speed_x * 1.1, max_speed_x)
        self.speed_y = min(self.speed_y * 1.1, max_speed_y)
    ```
