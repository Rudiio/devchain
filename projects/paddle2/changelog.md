- ball.py: Updated the `reset` method prototype to `def reset(self):` to remove parameters and reset the ball to a fixed position, typically the center of the screen.
- ball.py: Modified the `reset` method to set `self.x` and `self.y` to the center of the screen (`self.screen_width // 2` and `self.screen_height // 2` respectively).
- ball.py: Modified the `reset` method to reverse the ball's horizontal direction by setting `self.speed_x` to `-self.speed_x`.
- game.py: (Note: This change is outside of `ball.py` but related to its usage) Updated the call to `self.ball.reset()` to pass the correct `x` and `y` coordinates as `self.ball.reset(self.screen_width // 2, self.screen_height // 2)`.- ai.py: Modified `update` method prototype to `update(self, ball: Ball)`.
- ai.py: Updated AI paddle movement logic to scale with difficulty level by multiplying `self.paddle.speed` with `self.difficulty`.
- ai.py: Ensured AI paddle stays within game boundaries after movement adjustments.- game.py: Updated `check_score` method to call `self.ball.reset(self.screen_width // 2, self.screen_height // 2)`.
- game.py: Updated `reset` method to call `self.ball.reset(self.screen_width // 2, self.screen_height // 2)`.
- ball.py: Modified `reset` method in `Ball` class to be parameterless, now defined as `def reset(self):`.
- game.py: Added `screen_width` and `screen_height` as attributes in `Game` class constructor `def __init__(self, max_score):`.
- game.py: Set `screen_width` and `screen_height` during game initialization in `initialize_game_elements` method, now defined as `def initialize_game_elements(self, screen_width, screen_height, ...):`.
- game.py: Added method `def move_player_paddle_up(self):` to move the player paddle up.
- game.py: Added method `def move_player_paddle_down(self):` to move the player paddle down.- main.py: Modified `handle_events` method in `Main` class to call `game.move_player_paddle_up()` and `game.move_player_paddle_down()` instead of manipulating `player_paddle` directly.
- main.py: Added methods `move_player_paddle_up(self)` and `move_player_paddle_down(self)` to the `Game` class.
- main.py: Updated `Game` class to correctly handle the `reset` method of the `Ball` class, ensuring proper arguments are passed or modifying `Ball` class for a parameterless `reset` method.
- main.py: Investigated and ensured correct implementation of `move_up(self)` and `move_down(self)` methods in the `Paddle` class to respect game boundaries and verified their correct usage in the `Game` class.It appears there has been a misunderstanding. The provided code snippet is not a change to the `paddle.py` file but rather a suggested modification to the `Main` class, which is likely in a different file, to ensure that the paddle can be moved by the user. The `paddle.py` file itself was not modified based on the information given. The changes should be made in the file where the `Main` class is defined, not in `paddle.py`.

Therefore, no changes to summarize for `paddle.py` have been provided. If there are any specific changes made to `paddle.py`, please provide them, and I will summarize accordingly.- ball.py: Modified the `reset` method prototype to `reset(self, reset_x, reset_y)`.
- ball.py: Added parameters `reset_x` and `reset_y` to the `reset` method for specifying the ball's reset position.
- ball.py: Updated the `reset` method to set `self.x` to `reset_x` and `self.y` to `reset_y`.
- ball.py: Updated the `reset` method to reverse the ball's horizontal direction by setting `self.speed_x` to `-self.speed_x`.- game.py: Modified `Game.reset(self)` to calculate the center of the screen and pass these coordinates to `Ball.reset(center_x, center_y)`.
- game.py: Updated `Game.check_score(self)` to reset the ball to the center of the screen using `Ball.reset(center_x, center_y)` when a score is made.- main.py: Updated the `handle_events` method prototype to `handle_events(self)` to include calls to `self.game.player_paddle.move_up()` and `self.game.player_paddle.move_down()` within the `pygame.KEYDOWN` event conditionals.
- main.py: Modified the `handle_events` method to use `==` instead of `is` for comparing `event.type` with `pygame.QUIT` and `pygame.KEYDOWN`.- main.py: Modified the `handle_events` method prototype to `handle_events(self)` to use `pygame.key.get_pressed()` for detecting continuous key presses, allowing smoother paddle movement.
- main.py: Confirmed that `self.clock.tick(60)` is already implemented to ensure the game loop runs at a consistent frame rate of 60 FPS; no changes required.
