As a player, I want the game to end if the snake collides with the walls or itself.
    Acceptance criteria:
    - If the snake's head moves into a grid cell at the boundary of the play area, the game should end and display a "Game Over" message.
    - If the snake's head moves into a grid cell occupied by its body, the game should end and display a "Game Over" message.
