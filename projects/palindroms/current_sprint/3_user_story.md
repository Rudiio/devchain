As a user, I want the program to ignore spaces, punctuation, and special characters when verifying palindromes.
    Acceptance criteria:
    - The verification process should ignore spaces, punctuation, and special characters, so "A man, a plan, a canal: Panama" should be recognized as a palindrome.
