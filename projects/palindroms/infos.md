# Project Informations

## Request
Simple program to verify palidroms in C.

## Name
Palindrome Verifier Pro

## Description
The Palindrome Verifier Pro is an application designed to determine whether a given string is a palindrome. It will feature a simple command-line interface that allows users to input strings of up to 256 characters. The application will cater to a global audience by supporting palindrome verification across various languages that utilize the Latin alphabet. To ensure inclusivity and accuracy, the verification process will be case-insensitive and will disregard spaces, punctuation, and special characters. The core functionality will be built around two main functions: one that normalizes the input string by converting it to lowercase and stripping out non-alphabetic characters, and another that checks if the normalized string is a palindrome. The application will prioritize performance, aiming to deliver results swiftly, within a few seconds of input submission. It will also provide clear error messaging for invalid inputs or unexpected errors. The entire program will be written in C and will be thoroughly documented with comments to explain the code and underlying logic, ensuring maintainability and ease of understanding for future developers.
