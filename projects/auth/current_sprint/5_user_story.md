As a user, I want the system to protect my session with a timeout feature that automatically logs me out after a period of inactivity.
    Acceptance criteria:
    - The system should automatically log the user out after a predefined period of inactivity (e.g., 15 minutes).
    - The user should be notified before being logged out due to inactivity and given the option to extend their session.
