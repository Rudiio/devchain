### Review
#### Issues
1. The implementation of `session_manager.py` is mostly corresponding to the demanded FortressKey software, but it uses `check_password_hash` from `werkzeug.security` instead of the `Helper.check_password_hash` method as indicated by the changes.
2. The implementation of `session_manager.py` is not fully respecting the design or the changes. The `login_user` method should be using the `Helper.check_password_hash` method to adhere to the design that specifies the use of the `Helper` class for password-related operations.
3. The code logic inside of `session_manager.py` is mostly correct, but it does not follow the updated password checking mechanism that includes the use of salts as specified in the changes to `helper.py`.
4. All essential functions of `session_manager.py` appear to be fully implemented according to the class diagram.

#### Fixes
1. Update the `login_user` method to use the `Helper.check_password_hash` method instead of `check_password_hash` from `werkzeug.security`. Here is a code snippet to correct that:
    ```python
    from helper import Helper  # Import the Helper class

    def login_user(self, username, password):
        """
        Log in a user by checking their username and password.

        :param username: The username of the user attempting to log in.
        :param password: The password provided by the user.
        :return: True if login is successful, False otherwise.
        """
        user = self.user_manager.find_user_by_username(username)
        if user and Helper.check_password_hash(user.password_hash, password):
            session['user_id'] = user.username
            session['logged_in'] = True
            session.permanent = True
            self.app.permanent_session_lifetime = self.session_timeout
            return True
        else:
            flash('Invalid username or password.', 'error')
            return False
    ```
