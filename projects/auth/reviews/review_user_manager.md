### Review
#### Issues
1. The implementation of `user_manager.py` seems to correspond to the demanded FortressKey software in terms of managing user registration, password reset, and user validation. However, the user feedback indicates a missing registration feature in the UI, which is not directly related to `user_manager.py` but to the overall application flow.
2. The implementation of `user_manager.py` respects the design and the changes. The UserManager class uses the User class to create and manage user objects and the Helper class for password validation, which aligns with the class diagram.
3. The code logic inside of `user_manager.py` appears to be correct. It handles user registration, searching for users by username, password reset, and validation of usernames, passwords, and emails.
4. All the essential functions of `user_manager.py` seem to be fully implemented as per the class diagram. However, the application's execution output and user feedback suggest that the UI lacks a registration button, which is not a direct responsibility of the UserManager class but rather an issue with the application's routing or template rendering.

#### Fixes
To address the user feedback regarding the missing registration button, the following steps should be taken, although they are not part of the `user_manager.py` file:

1. Ensure that the `App` class's `configure_routes` method includes a route for user registration that renders a registration form.
2. Add a registration form template that includes a registration button and the necessary input fields for username, password, and email.
3. Ensure that the registration form is correctly linked to the `register_user` method of the `UserManager` class through the appropriate route in the Flask application.

Here is a hypothetical code snippet to add a registration route to the `App` class (assuming Flask app structure):

```python
# In the App class
def configure_routes(self):
    @self.app.route('/register', methods=['GET', 'POST'])
    def register():
        if request.method == 'POST':
            username = request.form['username']
            password = request.form['password']
            email = request.form['email']
            try:
                user = self.user_manager.register_user(username, password, email)
                # Redirect to login page or dashboard after successful registration
                return redirect(url_for('login'))
            except BadRequest as e:
                # Handle registration error
                return render_template('register.html', error=e.description)
        return render_template('register.html')
```
