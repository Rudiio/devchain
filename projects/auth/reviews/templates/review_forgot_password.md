### Review
#### Issues
1. The implementation of `templates/forgot_password.html` seems to correspond to the demanded FortressKey software in terms of providing a user interface for resetting a password. However, the execution output indicates a `404` error when trying to access `styles.css`, which suggests a potential issue with the static file path or the existence of the file itself.
2. The implementation of `templates/forgot_password.html` respects the design in terms of providing a form for password reset functionality. However, the `404` error for `styles.css` needs to be addressed to ensure the page is styled as intended.
3. The code logic inside of `templates/forgot_password.html` appears to be correct. It includes a form that posts to the `forgot_password` route and requires an email input from the user. There is also a conditional block to display error messages if any are present.
4. All the essential functions of `templates/forgot_password.html` seem to be fully implemented. The form is set up to collect the user's email and submit it for a password reset link. There is also a link to navigate back to the login page.

#### Fixes
1. To fix the `404` error for the `styles.css`, ensure that the stylesheet file exists in the correct location within the `static` directory and that the path specified in the `href` attribute of the `link` tag is correct. If the file is missing, it should be created or restored. Here is a code snippet to correct that:
    ```html
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="{{ url_for('static', filename='styles.css') }}">
    ```
   Ensure that the `filename` corresponds to the actual name and extension of the CSS file within the `static` directory.
