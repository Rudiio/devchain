### Review
#### Issues
1. The implementation of `templates/register.html` seems to correspond to the demanded FortressKey software as it provides a form for user registration.
2. The implementation of `templates/register.html` respects the design and the changes. It provides a user interface for registration, which is expected to interact with the backend `UserManager.register_user` method.
3. The code logic inside of `templates/register.html` appears to be correct. It includes form fields for username, password, and email, which are essential for the registration process.
4. The essential functions of `templates/register.html` seem to be fully implemented in terms of the HTML form. However, the execution output indicates a `404` error for the `styles.css`, which suggests that the stylesheet is either missing or not correctly linked.

#### Fixes
1. To fix the `404` error for the `styles.css`, ensure that the stylesheet file exists in the correct location within the `static` directory and that the path specified in the `href` attribute of the `link` tag is correct. If the file is missing, it should be created or restored.
