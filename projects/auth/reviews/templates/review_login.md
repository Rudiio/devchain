### Review
#### Issues
1. The implementation of `templates/login.html` seems to correspond to the demanded FortressKey software as it provides a login interface for users.
2. The implementation of `templates/login.html` respects the design and the changes. It uses Flask's `url_for` to generate URLs, which is consistent with Flask's templating practices.
3. The code logic inside of `templates/login.html` appears to be correct. It displays flashed messages, provides a form for login, and includes necessary input fields for username and password.
4. All the essential functions of `templates/login.html` seem to be fully implemented for the login process. However, the user feedback indicates an issue with registration, which is not part of this template. The registration process would be handled in a different template, which is not under review here.

#### Fixes
No fixes are required for `templates/login.html` based on the current review. However, the inability to register mentioned in the user feedback should be investigated in the context of the registration template and the associated Flask routes and functions in the `UserManager` class.
