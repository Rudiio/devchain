### Review
#### Issues
1. The implementation of `helper.py` seems to correspond to the demanded FortressKey software in terms of providing utility functions for password hashing and checking.
2. The implementation of `helper.py` respects the design as it provides the methods `hash_password`, `check_password_hash`, and `generate_password_salt` as specified in the class diagram.
3. There is a major logic flaw in the `check_password_hash` method. The method assumes that the salt is the first 32 characters of the `password_hash`, which may not be correct if the salt length changes or if the `generate_password_hash` function does not prepend the salt to the hash.
4. All essential functions of `helper.py` appear to be implemented as per the class diagram.

#### Fixes
3. To correct the logic flaw in the `check_password_hash` method, we need to ensure that the salt and the hash are stored and retrieved in a consistent manner. One way to do this is to store the salt and the hash as separate fields in the database or to use a delimiter to separate them in the stored string. Here is a code snippet to correct that:
    ```python
    def hash_password(password):
        salt = Helper.generate_password_salt()
        password_hash = generate_password_hash(password + salt)
        return f"{salt}${password_hash}"

    def check_password_hash(password_hash, password):
        salt, hash_val = password_hash.split('$', 1)
        return check_password_hash(hash_val, password + salt)
    ```
   This change assumes that the salt and the hash are stored in the format "salt$hash" and that the `$` character is not used in the salt or the hash.
