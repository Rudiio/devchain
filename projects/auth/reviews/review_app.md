### Review
#### Issues
1. The `register` route implementation in `app.py` does not correspond to the demanded FortressKey software design. The registration logic is not using the `UserManager.register_user` method as it should according to the design.
2. The `register` route implementation is not respecting the design changes. It is performing validation checks directly within the route, which should be handled by the `UserManager.register_user` method according to the provided fixes.
3. The code logic inside of `app.py` has a major logic flaw in the `register` route. It is not correctly handling exceptions that may be raised by the `UserManager.register_user` method, which could be the reason users are unable to register.
4. All essential functions of `app.py` appear to be implemented, but the `forgot_password` route is not fully implemented as it lacks the actual password reset logic.

#### Fixes
1. Modify the `register` route to use the `UserManager.register_user` method and handle exceptions properly. Here is a code snippet to correct that:
    ```python
    @self.app.route('/register', methods=['GET', 'POST'])
    def register():
        if request.method == 'POST':
            username = request.form['username']
            password = request.form['password']
            email = request.form['email']
            
            try:
                # Use UserManager to register user
                user = self.user_manager.register_user(username, password, email)
                flash('Registration successful! Please log in.', 'success')
                return redirect(url_for('login'))
            except Exception as e:
                flash(str(e), 'error')
        return render_template('register.html')
    ```
2. Ensure that the `UserManager.register_user` method is used and that it handles all validation and exception logic internally, as per the design changes.
3. Implement the actual password reset logic in the `forgot_password` route. This should involve generating a password reset token, sending an email to the user, and allowing the user to reset their password using the token. This is outside the scope of the current review, but it should be noted for future implementation.
