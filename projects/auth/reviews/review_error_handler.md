### Review
#### Issues
1. The implementation of `error_handler.py` seems to correspond to the demanded FortressKey software as it provides generic error messages for different types of errors without revealing sensitive information.
2. The implementation of `error_handler.py` respects the design and the changes. It provides static methods to handle different types of errors which align with the class diagram.
3. The code logic inside of `error_handler.py` is correct in terms of providing generic error messages to avoid revealing sensitive information.
4. All the essential functions of `error_handler.py` appear to be fully implemented as per the class diagram. However, the user feedback indicates an issue with registration, which may not be directly related to `error_handler.py` but could be due to the integration with other parts of the application.

#### Fixes
No fixes are required for `error_handler.py` based on the current review. However, the user feedback about the inability to register should be investigated in the context of the entire application, particularly the `UserManager.register_user` method and the Flask routes handling the registration process.

### Need to correct
