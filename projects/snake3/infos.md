## Request
A snake game in python

## Name
Pythonic Serpent

## Description
The Pythonic Serpent application is a classic snake game implemented in Python using the pygame library for graphics and user input handling. The game allows the player to control the snake's movement using the arrow keys, with smooth and responsive motion. The snake grows longer each time it eats the food, which appears in a new random position on the screen. The game ends if the snake collides with the walls or itself, displaying a "Game Over" message. Additionally, the game keeps track of the player's score, which increases with each food eaten, and includes sound effects for actions such as eating the food and ending the game. The graphical interface features visual representations of the snake, food, and game boundaries, providing an engaging and interactive gaming experience.
