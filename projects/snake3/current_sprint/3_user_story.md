As a player, I want the game to end if the snake collides with the walls or itself.
    Acceptance criteria:
    - If the snake's head touches the game boundaries, the game should end and display the "Game Over" message.
    - If the snake's head collides with its own body, the game should end and display the "Game Over" message.
