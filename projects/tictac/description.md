Tic-Tac-Toe Triumph is a digital rendition of the classic Tic-Tac-Toe game designed to be played on a single device by two players taking turns. The game will be developed using Python and the Pygame library, ensuring a smooth user experience with engaging graphics and animations.

**Core Features:**

1. **New Game Functionality**: Players will be greeted with a simple and intuitive main screen, featuring a prominent "New Game" button. Pressing this button will initiate a fresh game by resetting the board and score, allowing players to start a new round without delay.

2. **Turn-Based Gameplay**: The game interface will clearly indicate which player's turn it is (X or O). During a player's turn, they can select an empty cell on the board to place their symbol by clicking on it. The system will prevent players from making invalid moves, such as placing a symbol in an occupied cell.

3. **Win and Draw Detection**: The game will automatically evaluate the board after each move to determine if a player has won by aligning three of their symbols (X or O) horizontally, vertically, or diagonally. It will also detect a draw when all cells are filled without any winning combination. Upon winning or drawing, a clear and visually distinct announcement will be displayed.

4. **Aesthetic Interface and Animations**: The game will boast a visually appealing interface with smooth animations for actions such as placing X's and O's, celebrating a win, or acknowledging a draw. The design will be clean and user-friendly, catering to players of all ages.

5. **Status Display**: Throughout the game, players will be informed of the current status, including which player's turn it is, the ongoing score, and any relevant announcements regarding the outcome of the game.

**Technical and Design Requirements:**

- The application must be developed in Python, utilizing the Pygame library for rendering the game's interface.
- The user interface should be straightforward and easy to navigate, ensuring accessibility for a broad audience.
- The game is intended for local two-player mode, played on a single machine with players alternating turns.
- Visual elements like the game board, symbols, and status messages should be graphically appealing and contribute to an enjoyable gaming experience.
- The game's logic should handle scenarios such as invalid moves gracefully, providing feedback to the players without disrupting the flow of the game.

The goal of Tic-Tac-Toe Triumph is to provide a modern and entertaining twist on a timeless game, incorporating a blend of classic gameplay with contemporary design and technology.
