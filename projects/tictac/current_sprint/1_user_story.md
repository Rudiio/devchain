As a player, I want to start a new game of Tic-Tac-Toe with a friend so that we can play together on one device.
    Acceptance criteria:
    - The game should present a "New Game" button on the main screen.
    - Clicking the "New Game" button should reset the game board and score, and allow us to start playing immediately.
