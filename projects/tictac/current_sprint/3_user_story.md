As a player, I want the game to recognize when I or my friend has won or if the game is a draw.
    Acceptance criteria:
    - The game should automatically detect and announce a winner when a player has three of their symbols in a line (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally).
    - The game should announce a draw if all cells are filled without a winner.
    - The announcement should be visually clear and distinct.
