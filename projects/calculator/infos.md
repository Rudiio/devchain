# Project Informations

## Request
A calculator web application. Use python and flask only to render the front-end of the application. Do all the operations
directly in the front-end via javascript. Style the application with CSS and add an element to display the current operations.

## Name
QuickCalc Web

## Description
**QuickCalc Web Application Overview**

QuickCalc Web is a web-based application designed to provide users with a simple, intuitive, and visually appealing interface for performing basic arithmetic operations. The application aims to facilitate quick and responsive calculations directly within a user's web browser without the need for backend computation. 

**Key Features:**

1. **Basic Arithmetic Operations**: Users should be able to perform addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division operations.

2. **Real-Time Display**: The application will show a sequence of inputs and operations as they are entered, updating the display in real-time with each button press.

3. **Clear Functionality**: A clear button ('C') will allow users to reset their current operation and start anew without the need to refresh the page.

4. **Modern Design**: The interface should be modern, clean, and user-friendly, with a clear distinction between the display area and the input buttons to enhance the user experience.

**Technical Requirements:**

1. **Python and Flask**: The web application will be developed using the Python programming language with the Flask framework to handle the rendering of the front-end.

2. **JavaScript Operations**: All arithmetic operations will be executed on the front-end using JavaScript to ensure the calculator's responsiveness.

3. **CSS Styling**: The application will utilize CSS for styling, ensuring that the calculator is not only functional but also visually appealing.

4. **Display Element**: An element such as a display screen will be included to show the current operation and the result.

5. **User-Friendly Design**: The design of the application should be intuitive, with a focus on ease of use and accessibility.

6. **No Backend Computation**: The application is designed to perform all calculations on the client side, eliminating the need for server-side computation and ensuring faster performance.

The QuickCalc Web application is envisioned as a tool that users can rely on for quick calculations, with a focus on simplicity and efficiency. The developer should ensure that the application adheres to the outlined features and requirements to meet the needs of the end-users effectively.
