As a user, I want to be able to clear my current operation so that I can start a new calculation without refreshing the page.
    Acceptance criteria:
    - There should be a clear button ('C') that when pressed, clears the current operation displayed.
    - Pressing the clear button should reset the state of the current calculation.
