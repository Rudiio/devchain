## File list
[test_snake_movement.py, test_snake_growth_and_collision.py, test_food_spawn.py, test_gameplay_and_scoring.py]

- `test_snake_movement.py`: This file will contain tests for the snake's movement in all directions, the prohibition of reverse direction movement, and the responsiveness of the snake's movement to user input.
- `test_snake_growth_and_collision.py`: This file will include tests for the snake's growth mechanism when consuming food, collision detection with the game boundaries and its own body, and the game's stability when the snake grows to a large size.
- `test_food_spawn.py`: This file will focus on testing the food spawning logic, ensuring that the food appears in a new location after being eaten and does not spawn on the snake's body.
- `test_gameplay_and_scoring.py`: This file will test the overall game state management, including game over conditions, score display and incrementation during gameplay, accurate score tracking, and game reset after a game over scenario.
