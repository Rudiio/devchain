The Serpentine Challenge is a classic snake game that will be developed using Python and the pygame library to ensure a smooth gaming experience with a graphical user interface. The core gameplay involves a snake that the player controls using the arrow keys on the keyboard, with the goal of eating food that randomly appears on the screen. Each time the snake eats the food, it grows longer by one segment, and the player's score increases.

Key features and requirements of the Serpentine Challenge application include:

1. **Snake Movement Control**:
   - The player must be able to control the snake using the arrow keys.
   - The snake's movement should be smooth and responsive, with no lag or stuttering.

2. **Snake Growth Mechanism**:
   - The snake should grow by one segment each time it consumes the food.
   - The food should reappear at a new random location within the game boundaries after being eaten.

3. **Game Over Conditions**:
   - The game ends when the snake either collides with the walls or with its own body.
   - A "Game Over" message should be displayed when the game ends due to either of these conditions.

4. **Score Display and Tracking**:
   - The player's current score should be visible on the screen at all times during gameplay.
   - The score should increment by a predefined amount with each piece of food the snake eats.

5. **Graphical User Interface**:
   - The game should feature a graphical interface that visually represents the snake, the food, and the game boundaries.
   - The interface should be designed to be clear and visually appealing to enhance the player's experience.

6. **Technical Requirements**:
   - The game must be implemented in Python, utilizing the pygame library to handle graphics and user input.
   - The code should be well-structured and maintainable, with consideration for future updates or enhancements.

The goal of the Serpentine Challenge is to create an engaging and fun experience for players while maintaining a simple and intuitive control scheme. The game should challenge players to achieve high scores by surviving as long as possible and consuming as much food as they can without colliding with the game boundaries or the snake's own growing body.
